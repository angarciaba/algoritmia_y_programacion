The START Command does nothing nor even print any information or warning. I tried to understand the problem by digging in the archives:

**$ cat supervisord.conf**
[supervisord]
nodaemon=true

[program:xvfb]
command=/usr/bin/Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1280x864x16 -ac -pn -noreset

[program:x11vnc]
command=x11vnc -forever -shared -rfbport 5900 -display :99

[program:novnc]
command=/home/ubuntu/noVNC/utils/launch.sh --vnc localhost:5900 --listen %(ENV_PORT)s

[program:fluxbox]
command=fluxbox
environment=DISPLAY=:99

I tried to execute each command from the shell. And the following command gives some errors:

**$ /home/ubuntu/noVNC/utils/launch.sh**
Warning: could not find self.pem
No installed websockify, attempting to clone websockify...
fatal: could not create work tree dir '/home/ubuntu/noVNC/utils/websockify': Permission denied
Unable to locate /home/ubuntu/noVNC/utils/websockify/run after downloading

Obviously, it needs root access to install "websockify":

**$ sudo /home/ubuntu/noVNC/utils/launch.sh**
Warning: could not find self.pem

Press Ctrl-C to exit

Here we go. The server is up an running although with incorrect ports, etc. I kill it (Ctrl-C). And the START Command finally goes to life. All is working pretty good now. :)
